# BirdCage
A Chrome extension that lets you download any tweet as an image.

Tired of people making fun of your cropping skills?
Well why improve on a basic, fundamental aspect of image sharing when you can get an extension to do it for you? You lazy bastard.

BirdCage adds a button to the twitter website that allows you to download any tweet as an image. 

## Technical
BirdCage uses html2Canvas internally (and soon a custom version of it). The creator of html2Canvas said that it was a bad idea to use it in a browser extension. I said "bet" and did it anyway. 

## TODO
Fix some minor and major spacing issues.
Add support for videos and gifs
